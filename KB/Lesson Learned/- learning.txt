Went Wrong

- Lack of instant messaging communication channel in the start of the implementation. Ideally we should setup a IKM group where team can quickly exchange thoughts and queries.
- Inadequate requests by Partner : Parloa was sharing information in bits & pieces - ideally they should come up with the low level detailed plan i.e. a kind of a checklist, that could be used in one go to get the requirements from the stakeholders particularly client.
- No back ground shared Prior to the calls - Ideally host should share some background/agenda in the meeting invite and specifically 
- Inadequate Escalation path: resources involved in the task must be able to address in person rather than escalation to each others supervisor's
- some teams were not involved from the start. we should involve the teams from the start. involve affected team in the advance stages
- Lack of SME (telephony) - we 
- Lack of documentation - Meeting notes

- Lack of Governance
- unrealistic deadlines for implementations
- overallocation of the resources on Wave iX, which cause PM to work other (no)Projects
- Insufficient Training: Users struggled due to inadequate hands-on training sessions 
- Inadequate way of setting up expectations - ideally we need to clearly setup expectation in terms of their role.
- Inadequate meeting subjects: sometimes multiple mail threads were created that address the same piece-  ideally
- inadequate Process Adherence:
